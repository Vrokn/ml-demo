## 📐 Project Approach and Highlights

- Styling

In this project, I've demonstrated the flexibility of using multiple styling approaches, including styled components, inline styling, and SCSS modules. My goal was to illustrate my proficiency in handling different styling stacks and adapt to various project requirements. Whether creating custom components or utilizing built-in solutions, I've shown that I can craft responsive and aesthetic user interfaces.

State Management and Performance
Here are some key aspects that were taken into consideration:

-TypeScript: Leveraging TypeScript to ensure type safety and code clarity, enhancing maintainability.
-State Management: Using Context API instead of Redux to simplify state management and avoid unnecessary complexity.
-Centralization of Functionality: I've centralized features like the favorites list to avoid prop drilling and potential performance issues.
-Compartmentalizing Shared Functionality: This practice helps in preventing code duplication and facilitates code maintainability.
-Performance Considerations: The implementation has been carefully crafted to avoid local storage-related performance issues and minimize unnecessary browser API calls during render.
-Simplicity and Code Quality: By using built-in tools, libraries, and simplified data fetching code, the application maintains a high level of quality without excess boilerplate.

## 🌟 Recommendations and Positives

-Fulfillment of Requirements: The application meets the specified requirements, with features being added or removed as expected.
-Theming and Data Handling: Paying attention to these crucial aspects ensures a cohesive user experience and robust functionality.
-Conscious Development: Taking the time to complete the assignment thoughtfully rather than rushing through it reflects a commitment to quality and understanding.
